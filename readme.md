Encompass Search Chrome Extension
---------------------------------

a small / simple chrome extension to use [Trexler Library's Encompass Search](http://muhlenberg.worldcat.org/) (WorldCat Local) service.

__note:__ [Google has recently disabled side-loaded extensions for Windows](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2014/05/protecting-chrome-users-from-malicious.html), so this will only work if you're using a Mac, or the dev or Canary builds of Chrome for Windows.
